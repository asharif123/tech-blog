# Tech Blog

Tech Blog is an assignment that allows user to add, update and delete messages and works just like a messaging app.

This was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript to define frontend/backend code, Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL2 library to retrive information from SQL databases to allow users to 
login and send/update/delete messages.


# Login/Sign Up

Here the user is directed to the login/signup page. The user cannot see the post messages or comments until the user either creates a new account or logs in with an
existing account.
